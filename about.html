      <p>		When coming up with the name for my company, I 
			wanted something that would represent my company well, 
			Higher Tide Media did just that. Just as it’s stated in the 
			name “Higher Tide,” my company strives at producing top 
			notch media, a higher standard of design and experiences.  
			My goal was to have a company that not only could serve
			the “big dogs” in the media world, but also cared enough 
			about the smaller ones as well. At HigherTideMedia, not 
			only do we do just that, we also provide the best all around 
			experience for the client.<br><br> 
				Whether it’s the brand new sports store on the corner
			of 5th and Main, the stay-at-home mom who sells holiday 
			wreaths on the side, your brothers new rock band or the 
			local church event, Higher Tide Media is the right company 
			for the job. Higher Tide Media appeals to all ages, 
			occupations and backgrounds. If it’s professional, high 
			quality standards and a great client experience they are 
			looking for, Higher Tide Media is the right choice hands 
			down.
